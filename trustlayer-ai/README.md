# TrustLayer – Invisible AI Provenance Stamp

**Brought to you by the mysterious Mictoshi Nakamoto**  
*(the shadowy figure who allegedly dropped this code in a dark alley and vanished like a true provenance ghost — voluntary labeling only, no double-spending allowed)*

Open-source tool for adding **transparent, invisible watermarks** to AI-generated **images** and **audio** (voluntary labeling for trust & transparency).

**Why?**  
Creators can honestly label "This was made with AI". Viewers/fact-checkers get an easy way to verify.

**How it Works**  
- **Images**: Embeds self-similar pattern or fallback in high spatial frequencies (imperceptible).  
- **Audio**: Embeds in inaudible bands (ultrasonic 21-24 kHz + infrasound 10-18 Hz for better compression survival).  

**Features**  
- Fully local/offline – privacy-first.  
- Invisible/inaudible normally.  
- Survives mild edits/compression (lossless best).  
- MIT Licensed – free for any use.

**Important Disclaimer**  
Voluntary transparency tool only. Not foolproof – can be removed by adversaries. Ultrasonics may be stripped by MP3/YouTube; infrasound helps but not guaranteed.
